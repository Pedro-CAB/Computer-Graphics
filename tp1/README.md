## TP 1 Notes

### Exercise 1
- We observed that it was possible to decompose the parallelogram into several triangles in order to create the object. 
- We also found many different ways of decomposing the figure into triangles, some with more triangles than others.
- Finally, we also understood that, in order to make an object visible from both sides, we need to specify the indexes for the vertices both in clockwise and counter-clockwise order. One of the sides will, of course, seem darker than the other because it's not facing the only enabled light source.
- In exercise 2 we had difficulties in Y
