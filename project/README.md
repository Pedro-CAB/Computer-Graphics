### Exercise 1

- The main goal of this exercise was to create a sphere using a variable number of slices and stacks. After that, we had also to apply a a texture on it.
- This was not difficult at all- if we analysed the exercise carefully, this one was preety similar to the creation of a prism in TP3, also using slices and stacks. However, there was a small difference on this task, which was the increment of the vertices- they were varying in 180 degrees and 90 degrees, in slices and stacks respectively. Finally, we had to apply the texture given, using the techniques learnt in the previous TP classes, which there were no difficulties. As a result, we completed this task successfully.

### Exercise 2

- In this exercise we had to create a panorama, using the sphere created in the previous exercise. What we needed to do was to invert the the normal vectores and the sphere's vertices, so that we could see to the its interior, besides the addition of another texture. Then, we had to apply the tranformations in order to make it bigger and also position with the coordinates of the scene's camera, using the techniques learnt in the first TP classes. The result is shown below:
